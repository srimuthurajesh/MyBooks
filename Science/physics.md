## 1. Classical physics - 
- the time of Galileo, Newton, maxwell 
- it is continuos and deterministics

## 2. Modern/Quantum physics 
- Study of small ie.atom

- Bozeman statistics - he studies about gas molecules
- Max Plank father of quantum physics - he told resonated energy is quantised
- Einstein found ligh is an particle, using photo electric effect - he told light is quantised
    -  he states light is photon which is chunk of energy,massless
    - later Einstein, concluded light has duality nature both wave particle
- Bohr told atom is quantised
- Bose Einstein statistics
- Debroglie states electron is also a wave(matter wave)
- Schrodinger derives function for waves, but not exact value about the wave function
- max born intrepreted that wave function value will be probability
- Heisenberg student of max born, matrix method uncertainity principle. so nothing is deterministic, nothing predictable    

## General relativity
- Einstein things about elevator in space which creates gravitation force
- if ball bends, when elevator accelerator

## Atom
1. JJ thompson -  Cathode ray - plum cake pudding model
2. rutherfold - gold foil experiment
3. niel bohr invented bohr atomic model

## Types of Forces
1. Strong force
2. Weak force
3. Electro magnetic force
4. Gravity(not included)
